## 1 Semantic Image Segmentation 

Semantic image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which is associated with a specific semantic category. In simpler terms, it's the process of labeling each pixel in an image with a class label that represents the type of object or region it belongs to.

## 2 Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) in Convolutional Neural Networks

Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) is a technique used in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual recognition tasks, particularly in addressing the challenge of variable input sizes. Traditional CNN architectures require fixed-size input images, which can be restrictive in real-world scenarios where images may have different aspect ratios or resolutions. SPP alleviates this constraint by enabling the CNN to accept input images of arbitrary sizes while still producing fixed-size feature maps.
